# `derive-mmio` - turning structures into MMIO access objects

## Rationale

In C it is very common to create structures that refer to Memory-Mapped I/O
(MMIO) peripherals:

```c
typedef volatile struct uart_t {
    uint32_t data;
    const uint32_t status;
} uart_t;

uart_t* p_uart = (uart_t*) 0x40008000;
```

In Rust, we have some issues:

1. There are no volatile types, only volatile pointer reads/writes. So we
   cannot mark a type as 'volatile' and have all accesses to its fields
   performed a volatile operations. And given that MMIO registers have
   side-effects (like writing to a FIFO), it is important that those
   accesses are volatile.
2. We must never construct a reference to an MMIO peripheral, because
   references are, well, dereferenceable, and LLVM is free to dereference
   them whenever it likes. This might cause unexpected reads of the MMIO
   peripheral and is considered UB.
3. Accessing a field of a struct without constructing a pointer to it used
   to be quite tricky, although as of Rust 1.51 we have
   [`core::ptr::addr_of_mut`] and as of Rust 1.84 we have `&raw mut`.

The usual solution to these problems is to auto-generate code based on some
machine-readable (but non-Rust) description of the MMIO peripheral. This
code will contain functions to get a 'handle' to a peripheral, and that
handle has methods to get a handle to each register within it, and those
handles have methods for reading, writing or modifying the register
contents. Unfortunately, this requires having a machine-readable (typically
SVD XML) description of the peripherals and those are either not always
available, or cover an entire System-on-Chip when a driver is in fact only
aiming to work with one common MMIO peripheral (e.g. the Arm PL011 UART that has
been licensed and copy-pasted in dozens of System-on-Chip designs).

## How this crate works

This crate presents an alternative solution.

Consider the code:

```rust
#[derive(derive_mmio::Mmio)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Uart {
    data: u32,
    #[mmio(Read)]
    status: u32,
    control: u32,
}
```

Note that your struct must be `repr(C)` and we will check this.

The `derive_mmio::Mmio` derive-macro will generate some new methods and types
for you. You can see this for yourself with `cargo doc` (or `cargo expand` if
you have installed `cargo-expand`), but our example will expand to something
like this (simplified):

```rust
// this is your type, unchanged
#[repr(C)]
struct Uart {
    data: u32,
    status: u32,
    control: u32
}
// this is a new 'handle' type
struct MmioUart {
    ptr: *mut Uart,
}
// some methods on the 'handle' type
impl MmioUart {
    pub fn pointer_to_data(&self) -> *mut u32 {
        unsafe { &raw mut (*self.ptr).data }
    }
    pub fn read_data(&self) -> u32 {
        let addr = unsafe { core::ptr::addr_of!((*self.ptr).data) };
        unsafe {
            addr.read_volatile()
        }
    }
    pub fn write_data(&mut self, value: u32) {
        let addr = self.pointer_to_data();
        unsafe { addr.write_volatile(value) }
    }
    pub fn modify_data<F>(&mut self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce(u32) -> u32,
    {
        let value = self.read_data();
        let new_value = f(value);
        self.write_data(new_value);
    }

    // but you can only read the status register
    pub fn pointer_to_status(&mut self) -> *mut u32 {
        unsafe { &raw mut (*self.ptr).status }
    }
    pub fn read_status(&mut self) -> u32 {
        let addr = self.pointer_to_status();
        unsafe { addr.read_volatile() }
    }

    // The control register methods are skipped here for brevity
}
// some new methods we add onto your type
impl Uart {
    pub const unsafe fn new_mmio(ptr: *mut Uart) -> MmioUart {
        MmioUart { ptr }
    }
    pub const unsafe fn new_mmio_at(addr: usize) -> MmioUart {
        MmioUart {
            ptr: addr as *mut Uart,
        }
    }
}
```

OK, that was a lot! Let's unpack it.

## The MMIO Handle

```rust,ignore
struct MmioUart {
    ptr: *mut Uart,
}
```

This structure, called `Mmio${StructName}` is a handle that proxies access
to that particular peripheral. You create as many as you need by unsafely
calling one of these methods we added to your struct type.

```rust,ignore
impl Uart {
    pub const unsafe fn new_mmio(ptr: *mut Uart) -> MmioUart {
        MmioUart { ptr }
    }
    pub const unsafe fn new_mmio_at(addr: usize) -> MmioUart {
        MmioUart {
            ptr: addr as *mut Uart,
        }
    }
}
```

One is for when you have a pointer, and the other is for when you only have
the address (typically as a literal integer you read from the System-on-Chip's
datasheet, like `0x4008_1000`).

It is unsafe to create these - you must verify that you are passing a valid
address or pointer, and that if you are creating multiple MMIO handles for one
peripheral at the same same that you use them in a way that complies with the
peripheral's rules around concurrent access. For example, don't create two
handles and use them to both do a read-modify-write on the *same* register
at the same time - that's a race hazard and the results won't be reliable. But
you could create two and use them to read-modify-write *different* registers -
probably. It depends on whether the registers affect each other or operate
in isolation.

The constructors shown above will be generated by default. You might want to
implement custom constructors, for example if your peripheral is only valid for
one specific address, or a specific set of addresses. You can disable the
generation of these constructors by adding the `#[mmio(no_ctors)]` attribute
annotation to your peripheral block structure.

## MMIO Methods

The MMIO handle has methods to access each of the fields in the underlying
struct.

You can read (which performs a volatile read):

```rust,ignore
println!("data = {}", mmio_uart.read_data());
```

You can write (which performs a volatile write):

```rust,ignore
mmio_uart.write_data(0x00);
```

And you can perform a read-modify-write (which requires exclusive access and
you should not use if any other code might modify this register
concurrently).

```rust,ignore
mmio_uart.modify_control(|mut r| {
    r &= 0xF000_0000;
    r |= 1 << 31;
    r
});
```

If you need a pointer to a register, for example if you want to have a DMA
engine write to a register on your peripheral, you can use this method:

```rust,ignore
let p: *mut u32 = mmio_uart.pointer_to_data();
```

### Inner Fields

If you have a field that is annotated with `#[mmio(Inner)]`, the derive macro
will generate getters for that field. Note that the type of such 'inner' fields
must be annotated with `#[derive(Mmio)]`.

The getter will have the same name as the field name of your peripheral block
and will have a lifetime tied to the outer MMIO structure.

```rust,ignore
// Given
#[derive(Mmio)]
struct Peripheral {
    #[mmio(Inner)]
    some_inner: InnerType
}

// You get a method like this:
impl MmioPeripheral {
    pub fn some_inner(&mut self) -> MmioInnerType<'_> {
        /// ...
    }
}
```

The macro will also generate an `unsafe` `steal_${inner_field}` method
which has a static lifetime, which in turn allows you to create an arbitrary
number of owned inner MMIO objects:

```rust,ignore
// Given
#[derive(Mmio)]
struct Peripheral {
    #[mmio(Inner)]
    some_inner: InnerType
}

// You get a method like this:
impl MmioPeripheral {
    pub unsafe fn steal_some_inner(&mut self) -> MmioInnerType<'static> {
        /// ...
    }
}
```

If you want to access your inner field through only a shared reference, access
is granted through the [`SharedInner`] wrapper type. This ensures you only have
access to non-mutable methods on the inner field.

```rust,ignore
// Given
#[derive(Mmio)]
struct Peripheral {
    #[mmio(Inner)]
    some_inner: InnerType
}

// You get methods like this:
impl MmioPeripheral {
    pub fn some_inner_shared(&self) -> SharedInner<MmioInnerType<'_>> {
        // ...
    }
    pub unsafe fn steal_some_inner_shared(&self) -> SharedInner<MmioInnerType<'static>> {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The [`SharedInner`] wrapper type implements [`Deref`] so it is transparent to
the user.

### Array Fields

Array Fields get two kinds of function - safe ones that perform a bounds check,
and unsafe ones which skip the bounds check.

```rust,ignore
// Given
#[derive(Mmio)]
struct Peripheral {
    bank: [u32; 4]
}

// You get methods like this:
impl MmioUart {
    pub fn pointer_to_bank_start(&mut self) -> *mut u32 {
        /// ...
    }

    pub fn read_bank(&self, index: usize) -> Result<u32, OutOfBoundsError> {
        // ...
    }

    pub unsafe fn read_bank_unchecked(&self, index: usize) -> u32 {
        // ...
    }

    pub fn write_bank(&mut self, index: usize, value: u32) -> Result<(), OutOfBoundsError> {
        // ...
    }

    pub unsafe fn write_bank_unchecked(&mut self, index: usize, value: u32) {
        // ...
    }

    pub fn modify_bank<F: FnOnce(u32) -> u32>(&mut self, index: usize, f: F) -> Result<(), OutOfBoundsError> {
        // ...
    }

    pub unsafe fn modify_bank_unchecked<F: FnOnce(u32) -> u32>(&mut self, index: usize, f: F) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Supported attributes

The following attributes are supported for fields with a struct which is wrapped
with `#[derive(Mmio)]`:

### Outer attributes

- `#[mmio(no_ctors)]`: Omit the generation of constructor functions like
  `new_mmio_at` and `new_mmio`. This allows users to specify their own custom
  constructors, for example to constrain or check the allowed base addresses.
- `#[mmio(const_ptr)]`: Pointer getter methods for array field are `const` now.
  Requires Rust 1.83.0 or higher.
- `#[mmio(const_inner)]`: Const getter methods for inner MMIO blocks. Requires Rust 1.83.0 or
  higher.

### Field attributes

The access permission attributes work for array fields as well.

- `#[mmio(PureRead)]`: The field is read-only. The read does not have side
  effects, and the generated reader function only requires a shared reference
  to the MMIO handle.
- `#[mmio(Read)]`: The field can be read, but the read has side effects. The
  generated reader function requires a mutable reference to the MMIO handle.
- `#[mmio(Write)]`: The field can be written to. This will generate a writer
  function for the field.
- `#[mmio(Modify)]`: The field can be modified. This will generate a modify
  function for the field which performs a Read-Modify-Write operation.
- `#[mmio(Inner)]`: The field is a register block. It must be a type which is
  `#[derive(Mmio)]`, which will be verified using trait bounds. The derive macro
  will generate getter functions to retrieve a handle for the inner block, with
  the lifetime of the inner handle tied to the outer handle.

If no permission access modifiers were specified, the library will default to
`PureRead`, `Write`, `Modify` which is the default for most regular R/W
registers.

## Supported field types

The following field types are supported and tested:

- [`u32`]
- Arrays of [`u32`]
- Bitfields implemented with [`bitbybit::bitfield`]
- Other `#[derive(Mmio)]` types, if the field is annotated with the
  `#[mmio(Inner)]` attribute. Arrays of inner MMIO types are also allowed.

[`bitbybit::bitfield`]: https://crates.io/crates/bitbybit

Other `repr(transparent)` types should work, but you should be careful to ensure
that every field corresponds 1:1 with an MMIO register and that they are the
appropriate size for your CPU architecture.

If you accidentally introduce padding (or, if the sum of the size of the
individual fields isn't the same as the size of the overall `struct`), you will
get a compile error.
